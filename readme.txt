A simple, functional WordPress plugin that serves as an example for creating new meta boxes for use on admin editor screens.

== Description ==

This plugin serves as a simple, functional, documented example for creating meta boxes for WordPress's editor screens. If you are not a developer, this plugin won't do anything for you.

Meta boxes let you create custom UI for your admin's editor screens, and add tremendous power and flexibility to WordPress. This plugin is intended to help make the creation of new meta boxes extremely simple. If you need to develop a plugin that adds new meta boxes to WordPress, this is a great place to start.

Adding a custom admin can now be accomplished in just two stepsâ€¦

1. Register your meta boxes using WordPress's add_meta_box() function.
2. Register your settings/form fields using this plugin's MetaBox::register_setting() function.

That's all there is to it. Form fields, saving, and loading are all handled for you magically. Detailed documentation can be found in the code comments.

This example is part of the NOUVEAU WordPress framework. For more great starting code, search for "Nouveau" in the WordPress.org's plugins or visit [www.nouveauframework.com]
